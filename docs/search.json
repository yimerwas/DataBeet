My research interest focuses on the use of linear and non-linear mixed-effect models, univariate and multivariate modeling approaches, Bayesian inference and predictions, advanced Bayesian kinetic models, Bayesian informative priors, and other advanced statistical techniques for product development and manufacturing. I am a first point of contact and focus area representative for process validation and stability study to support small molecule programs."
